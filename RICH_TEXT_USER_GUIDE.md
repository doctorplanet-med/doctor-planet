## Tips for Success

1. **Preview Before Saving**: Review your formatted description before saving to ensure it looks professional

2. **Don't Overformat**: Too much formatting can be distracting. Use it strategically.

3. **Mobile-Friendly**: Your formatted text will automatically adjust for mobile devices

4. **Consistency**: Try to format similar products in a similar way for a cohesive look

5. **Update Old Products**: Consider updating your existing products with formatted descriptions for a more professional appearance

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The formatting isn't appearing on the product page**
A: Make sure you've saved the product after formatting. The changes won't show until saved.

**Q: Can I copy and paste formatted text from Word?**
A: Yes, but the editor will clean up unnecessary formatting. It's better to format directly in the editor.

**Q: How do I remove formatting?**
A: Select the text and click the "Clear Formatting" button (eraser icon) in the toolbar.

**Q: Can I add images to the description?**
A: Currently, images are added separately in the product images section. The description field is for text only.
